#### _Turn a number string into "Robo-Rodgers speak"_	

  

#### By _**Tristan Emmerson**_

  

## **Description**

  

_This application will take a user submitted number string and convert that string into an output. That output is initialized as an array with all numbers, starting from 1, and ending with the user inputted number. Within that array of numbers, the digits will be "translated" upon the following rules. Numbers containing 1 will become "Beep!", and numbers containing 2 will become "Boop!", and further, numbers that contain a 3 will become "Won't you be my neighbor?" The rules for translation are in order from first to last. For example, the number 13 will pass the "Beep!" test, but ultimately will be translated to "Won't you be my neighbor", as that rule superceedes the former rule._
