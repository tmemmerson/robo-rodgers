GOALS
Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

FURTHER EXPLORATION
Add images, styling, and custom animations.
Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.
Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).
Add a second form field that takes a name. For numbers that are divisible by 3, add the users name to the output e.g. "Won't you be my neighbor, Dana?"

OBJECTIVES
JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
Application implements a loop and works as expected.
The user can use the app repeatedly and see new results.
All previous objectives have been met.
Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.
Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

PREVIOUS OBJECTIVES
Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
Project README that includes, bare minimum:
author name
program name
detailed setup instructions

copyright and license information


spec: all non-numeric and non-alphanumeric inputs will be rejected
input: OMGG 99s3!!& &*ROBO 445%%
ouput: "Please use only numbers. Our robot cannot translate such a complex and foreign alien language."

spec: take user input and assign to array
input: 13
output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]

spec: take user array and apply first order rule
input: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
output: [0,1,2,"Won't you be my neighbor?",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,"Won't you be my neighbor?"]

spec: take user array and apply second order rule
input: [0,1,2,"Won't you be my neighbor?",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,"Won't you be my neighbor?"]
output: [0,1,"Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,"Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?"]

spec: take user array and apply third order rule
input: [0,1,"Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,"Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?"]
output: [0,"Beep!","Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,"Beep!","Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?"]

spec: take user array after translation and display translated string to user
input: 13
output: "0,"Beep!","Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?",4,5,6,7,8,9,10,"Beep!","Boop!","Won't you be my neighbor?"
