GOALS
Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

FURTHER EXPLORATION
Add images, styling, and custom animations.
Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.
Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).
Add a second form field that takes a name. For numbers that are divisible by 3, add the users name to the output e.g. "Won't you be my neighbor, Dana?"

OBJECTIVES
JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
Application implements a loop and works as expected.
The user can use the app repeatedly and see new results.
All previous objectives have been met.
Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.
Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

PREVIOUS OBJECTIVES
Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
Project README that includes, bare minimum:
author name
program name
detailed setup instructions
